# Architecture for Contributors

This page supplements the [Concepts Overview](../concepts/overview.md) with contributor-focused guidance: package layout, extension points, and key design decisions to understand before making changes. Read the **Concepts Overview** first for the component model and execution lifecycle.

## Package Layout

The `rampart/` source tree is organized by concern: foundational types live in `core/`, while each extension point gets its own subpackage (`attacks/`, `probes/`, `evaluators/`, `drivers/`, `converters/`, `surfaces/`, `payloads/`, `reporting/`). The `pyrit_bridge/` package groups common PyRIT integration code (see [PyRIT Bridge](#pyrit-bridge) below), and `pytest_plugin/` provides the pytest integration.

- For the component model and how the pieces fit together at runtime, see the [Concepts Overview](../concepts/overview.md).
- For the public symbols exported from each package, see the [API Reference index](../api/index.md).
- For where to put new code, see [Extension Points](#extension-points) below.
- The authoritative layout is always the source tree itself — browse [`rampart/` on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/RAMPART/tree/main/rampart).

## Key Design Decisions

### Protocols Over ABCs

RAMPART uses `@runtime_checkable` protocols for extension points that consumers implement (`AgentAdapter`, `Session`, `Evaluator`, `Surface`, `PromptDriver`). This means:

- **No inheritance required** — any class with the right methods satisfies the protocol
- **Type-checked at development time** by [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty)
- **Verifiable at runtime** with `isinstance` checks

`BaseExecution` is the exception — it's an ABC because it owns the lifecycle skeleton and subclasses share real implementation.

### Factory Classes (`Attacks`, `Probes`)

`Attacks` and `Probes` are **static factory classes** that construct execution objects. They:

- Provide a clean, discoverable API: `Attacks.xpia(...)`, `Probes.behavior(...)`
- Handle input coercion (e.g., `coerce_driver` for flexible trigger input)
- Return `BaseExecution`, hiding the concrete execution class

When adding a new attack or probe, you add a static factory method — not a new class that users instantiate directly.

### Evaluator Polarity

Evaluators are **polarity-free**. They report whether a condition was detected, not whether it's good or bad. The attack/probe factory applies the correct polarity:

- `resolve_as_attack`: detected → UNSAFE
- `resolve_as_probe`: detected → SAFE

This allows the same evaluator (e.g., `ToolCalled`) to be used in both attack and probe contexts.

### Execution Lifecycle Ownership

`BaseExecution` owns all cross-cutting concerns:

- **Event dispatch** — ON_PRE_EXECUTE, ON_POST_EXECUTE, ON_ERROR
- **Timing** — wall-clock duration
- **Error handling** — all exceptions from `_execute_async` are caught and converted to ERROR results
- **Handler registration** — framework-level handlers (result collection) are injected automatically

Subclasses implement only `_execute_async` and `strategy_name`. They should **not** catch `InfrastructureError` — the base class handles it.

### Pytest Plugin

`pytest_plugin/` integrates RAMPART with pytest:

- `plugin.py` — hook registrations (configure, collection, sessionfinish, terminal summary, optional `pytest_testnodedown`).
- `_session.py` — session-scoped state container (`RampartSession`), trial-group aggregates, sink registry, idempotency and incomplete-run flags.
- `_collection.py` — per-test `ResultCollector` and the `ContextVar`-based handler that captures results from executions.
- `_xdist.py` — pytest-xdist support: detection helpers, JSON-safe serialization of `Result` objects, controller-side merge, and conftest-scanning sink discovery. Workers serialize their results into `config.workeroutput`; the controller deserializes via `pytest_testnodedown` and emits a single unified report. See [Parallel Execution](../usage/xdist.md) for the data flow and trust boundary.

### PyRIT Bridge

PyRIT is RAMPART's upstream dependency for converters and prompt generation. Its import chain is heavy, so:

- PyRIT-related logic is grouped under `rampart/pyrit_bridge/`
- Lazy imports inside functions are used to defer the cost
- This boundary keeps RAMPART's core import fast

| New converter | Implement `PayloadConverter` protocol | `rampart/converters/` |
| New report sink | Implement `ReportSink` protocol | `rampart/reporting/` |
| New payload format | Extend payload system | `rampart/payloads/` |

## Module Import Conventions

- Import from the package root (`rampart.core`, `rampart.attacks`) when the symbol is exported in `__init__.py`
- Within the same package, import from the specific module to avoid circular imports
- Internal modules are prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_xpia.py`, `_single_turn.py`) — they are not part of the public API
